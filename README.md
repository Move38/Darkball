# Darkball-Blinks
Darkball is a game by CW&T for Blinks

- 1 - âˆž
- 1 - 10 minute playtime

- like 1-D pong, but weirder
- timing is everything

## Setup
- Place Blinks tiles in a single path or multiple branches.

- Tiles that are connected to two or more tiles become paths.
- Tiles that are connected to one tile are considered endpoints.
- One player should be at each endpoint.

## Tiles
- Cyan tiles are endpoints that have the ball.
- Green tiles are endpoints without the ball.
- Orange tiles are paths
- Red tiles aren't connected to anything. 
- Double click red tiles to reset the tile to use as a new endpoint.
- Tribple click red tiles to enable Super Mode.


## Rules
- Each player controls just one Blinks tile at the end of a branch. 
- One player sends the ball along the path.
- The goal is for players to press their tile at the right moment to hit the ball and send it back along the path.
- If a player hits the ball to early or too late, they lose a point. 
- Game ends when a player loses all six points.

## Super Mode
- In Super Mode, the ball will only appear once in a while along the path, making it much hard to predict when the ball will arrive.


## Issues
- needs more juicy animations?
