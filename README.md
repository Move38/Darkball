# Darkball-Blinks
Darkball is a game for Blinks by Move38

- 1-infinite players?
- 1-10 minute playtime

- like 1-D pong, but weirder
- timing is everything

## Setup:
Place Blinks tiles in a single path or multiple branches.

- Each player controls just one Blinks tile at the end of a branch. 
- One player sends the ball along the path.
- The goal is for players to press their tile at the right moment to hit the ball and send it back along the path.
- If a player hits the ball to early or too late, they lose a point. 

- Game ends when a player loses all six points.


- Tiles that are connected to two or more tiles become paths.
- Tiles that are connected to one tile are considered endpoints.
- One player should be at each endpoint.

- Cyan tiles are endpoints that have the ball.
- Green tiles are endpoints without the ball.

- Red tiles aren't connected to anything. 
- Double click red tiles to reset the tile to use as a new endpoint.


## Issues:
- no juicy animations yet
- endpoints changes to cyan momentarily when it recieves the ball (even if you successfully hit it)
